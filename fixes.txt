To fix the toggle recipe functionality after moving the state, follow these steps:

1. Pass setRecipeShown as a prop from Chef.jsx to IngredientsList.jsx:
   - The state lives in Chef.jsx but the toggle function is in IngredientsList.jsx
   - IngredientsList needs access to setRecipeShown to toggle it

2. Update the IngredientsList component call in Chef.jsx to include setRecipeShown:
   <IngredientsList 
     key={ingredientsList.length} 
     ingredients={ingredients}
     ingredientsList={ingredientsList}
     setRecipeShown={setRecipeShown}
   />

3. Now toggleRecipeShown() in IngredientsList.jsx will have access to setRecipeShown via props and can toggle the state as intended.

The issue is a classic "lifting state up" React pattern - when a child component needs to modify state that lives in a parent component, the setter function must be passed down as a prop.

REVIEW OF CURRENT CODE:
- The toggleRecipeShown function in IngredientsList.jsx tries to use props.setRecipeShown, but this prop isn't being passed from Chef.jsx
- The length check props.ingredientsList.length >= 3 might be unreliable since ingredientsList is the rendered JSX list items, not the raw ingredients array
- Consider using props.ingredients.length >= 3 instead for the condition check
- The key prop on IngredientsList in Chef.jsx is good for forcing re-renders, but might not be necessary in this case

Required fixes:
1. Add setRecipeShown to IngredientsList component call in Chef.jsx
2. Change length check to use props.ingredients.length
3. Consider adding PropTypes or TypeScript for better props validation
